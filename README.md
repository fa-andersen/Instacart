In this project, I sought to uncover meaningful relationships within various customer profiles and reveal the performance of different products and departments within Instacart.

## Objective
Uncover more information about sales patterns. Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria. Present findings in an Excel Report.

## Key Questions
1. What are the busiest/slowest days of the week and hours of the day for orders?

2. Are there times of the day when people spend the most money?

3. Instacart marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings. Create those new groupings.

4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?

5. The marketing and sales teams are interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

      a. What’s the distribution among users regarding their brand loyalty?

      b. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

      c. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

      d. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

      e. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

      f. What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles?

## What did I do?
● Data Collection and Preparation: Using Python, I cleaned and wrangled the raw data, transforming it into structured data frames conducive to analysis.

● Exploratory Data Analysis: With a focus on understanding customer behavior, I used various statistical techniques and visualization tools to identify patterns and correlations across different customer segments.

● Product and Department Performance Evaluation: Through rigorous analysis, I evaluated the performance of Instacart's products and departments, pinpointing strengths and areas for improvement.

## Recommendations & Insights
With insights from the analysis, I created recommendations to enhance Instacart's operations and customer experience.

## Technologies & Skills used
● Python (Pandas, NumPy): for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis

● Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn): for creating visualizations

● Statistical Analysis: deriving meaningful insights from the data

## Data
The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle.

## Additional Information
Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, CareerFoundry has fabricated the project brief for students.
